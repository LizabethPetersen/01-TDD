### Documentation
In my greet.js module, the exported values are a function with one parameter (arity) that will return "Hello ${name}".

In my arithmetic.js module, the exported values are the addition and subtraction of two numbers (also the parameters). 

Expected output behavior for invalid use are NULL. For the arithmetic test, NULL will be logged if either input is not a number. For the greet test, NULL will be logged if the input is not a string or is an empty field.

I have not yet completed this lab and will resubmit when I have more time to work on and get help with this.
